# Stroke Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements machine learning models to predict stroke risk based on patient health data. The goal is to develop an accurate predictive model that can help healthcare professionals identify at-risk individuals early, enabling timely interventions and potentially saving lives.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Healthcare Stroke Dataset obtained from Kaggle, containing 5110 records and 12 features. Each record represents a patient, with features spanning demographic, health-related, and behavioral attributes.

Key features include:
- **Age**: Age of the patient in years
- **Gender**: Male, Female, or Other
- **Hypertension**: Indicates whether the patient has a history of hypertension
- **Heart Disease**: Presence of heart disease
- **Ever Married**: Marital status
- **Work Type**: Type of occupation
- **Residence Type**: Urban or rural
- **Average Glucose Level**: Blood glucose concentration in mg/dL
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index
- **Smoking Status**: Classified as 'never smoked,' 'formerly smoked,' or 'smokes'
- **Stroke**: The target variable indicating whether the patient has experienced a stroke
